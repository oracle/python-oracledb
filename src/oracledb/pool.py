        Constructor for creating a connection pool. Connection pooling creates
        a pool of available connections to the database, allowing applications
        to acquire a connection very quickly. It is of primary use in a server
        where connections are requested in rapid succession and used for a
        short period of time, for example in a web server.

        The dsn parameter (data source name) can be a string in the format
        user/password@connect_string or can simply be the connect string (in
        which case authentication credentials such as the username and password
        need to be specified separately). See the documentation on connection
        strings for more information.

        The params parameter is expected to be of type PoolParams and contains
        parameters that are used to create the pool. See the documentation on
        PoolParams for more information. If this parameter is not specified, the
        additional keyword parameters will be used to create an instance of
        PoolParams. If both the params parameter and additional keyword
        parameters are specified, the values in the keyword parameters have
        precedence. Note that if a dsn is also supplied, then in the
        python-oracledb Thin mode, the values of the parameters specified
        (if any) within the dsn will override the values passed as additional
        keyword parameters, which themselves override the values set in the

    """
    Creates a connection pool with the supplied parameters and returns it.

    The dsn parameter (data source name) can be a string in the format
    user/password@connect_string or can simply be the connect string (in
    which case authentication credentials such as the username and password
    need to be specified separately). See the documentation on connection
    strings for more information.

    The pool_class parameter is expected to be ConnectionPool or a subclass of
    ConnectionPool.

    The params parameter is expected to be of type PoolParams and contains
    parameters that are used to create the pool. See the documentation on
    PoolParams for more information. If this parameter is not specified, the
    additional keyword parameters will be used to create an instance of
    PoolParams. If both the params parameter and additional keyword parameters
    are specified, the values in the keyword parameters have precedence.
    Note that if a dsn is also supplied, then in the python-oracledb Thin mode,
    the values of the parameters specified (if any) within the dsn will override
    the values passed as additional keyword parameters, which themselves
    override the values set in the params parameter object.

    The following parameters are all optional. A brief description of each
    parameter follows:

    - min: the minimum number of connections the pool should contain (default:
      1)

    - max: the maximum number of connections the pool should contain (default:
      2)

    - increment: the number of connections that should be added to the pool
      whenever a new connection needs to be created (default: 1)

    - connectiontype: the class of the connection that should be returned
      during calls to pool.acquire(). It must be Connection or a subclass of
      Connection (default: None)

    - getmode: how pool.acquire() will behave. One of the constants
      oracledb.POOL_GETMODE_WAIT, oracledb.POOL_GETMODE_NOWAIT,
      oracledb.POOL_GETMODE_FORCEGET, or oracledb.POOL_GETMODE_TIMEDWAIT
      (default: oracledb.POOL_GETMODE_WAIT)

    - homogeneous: a boolean indicating whether the connections are homogeneous
      (same user) or heterogeneous (multiple users) (default: True)

    - timeout: length of time (in seconds) that a connection may remain idle in
      the pool before it is terminated. If it is 0 then connections are never
      terminated (default: 0)

    - wait_timeout: length of time (in milliseconds) that a caller should wait
      when acquiring a connection from the pool with getmode set to
      oracledb.POOL_GETMODE_TIMEDWAIT (default: 0)

    - max_lifetime_session: length of time (in seconds) that connections can
      remain in the pool. If it is 0 then connections may remain in the pool
      indefinitely (default: 0)

    - session_callback: a callable that is invoked when a connection is
      returned from the pool for the first time, or when the connection tag
      differs from the one requested (default: None)

    - max_sessions_per_shard: the maximum number of connections that may be
      associated with a particular shard (default: 0)

    - soda_metadata_cache: boolean indicating whether or not the SODA metadata
      cache should be enabled (default: False)

    - ping_interval: length of time (in seconds) after which an unused
      connection in the pool will be a candidate for pinging when
      pool.acquire() is called. If the ping to the database indicates the
      connection is not alive a replacement connection will be returned by
      pool.acquire(). If ping_interval is a negative value the ping
      functionality will be disabled (default: 60)

    - user: the name of the user to connect to (default: None)

    - proxy_user: the name of the proxy user to connect to. If this value is
      not specified, it will be parsed out of user if user is in the form
      "user[proxy_user]" (default: None)

    - password: the password for the user (default: None)

    - newpassword: the new password for the user. The new password will take
      effect immediately upon a successful connection to the database (default:
      None)

    - wallet_password: the password to use to decrypt the wallet, if it is
      encrypted. This value is only used in thin mode (default: None)

    - access_token: expected to be a string or a 2-tuple or a callable. If it
      is a string, it specifies an Azure AD OAuth2 token used for Open
      Authorization (OAuth 2.0) token based authentication. If it is a 2-tuple,
      it specifies the token and private key strings used for Oracle Cloud
      Infrastructure (OCI) Identity and Access Management (IAM) token based
      authentication. If it is a callable, it returns either a string or a
      2-tuple used for OAuth 2.0 or OCI IAM token based authentication and is
      useful when the pool needs to expand and create new connections but the
      current authentication token has expired (default: None)

    - host: the name or IP address of the machine hosting the database or the
      database listener (default: None)

    - port: the port number on which the database listener is listening
      (default: 1521)

    - protocol: one of the strings "tcp" or "tcps" indicating whether to use
      unencrypted network traffic or encrypted network traffic (TLS) (default:
      "tcp")

    - https_proxy: the name or IP address of a proxy host to use for tunneling
      secure connections (default: None)

    - https_proxy_port: the port on which to communicate with the proxy host
      (default: 0)

    - service_name: the service name of the database (default: None)

    - sid: the system identifier (SID) of the database. Note using a
      service_name instead is recommended (default: None)

    - server_type: the type of server connection that should be established. If
      specified, it should be one of "dedicated", "shared" or "pooled"
      (default: None)

    - cclass: connection class to use for Database Resident Connection Pooling
      (DRCP) (default: None)

    - purity: purity to use for Database Resident Connection Pooling (DRCP)
      (default: oracledb.PURITY_DEFAULT)

    - expire_time: an integer indicating the number of minutes between the
      sending of keepalive probes. If this parameter is set to a value greater
      than zero it enables keepalive (default: 0)

    - retry_count: the number of times that a connection attempt should be
      retried before the attempt is terminated (default: 0)

    - retry_delay: the number of seconds to wait before making a new connection
      attempt (default: 0)

    - tcp_connect_timeout: a float indicating the maximum number of seconds to
      wait for establishing a connection to the database host (default: 60.0)

    - ssl_server_dn_match: boolean indicating whether the server certificate
      distinguished name (DN) should be matched in addition to the regular
      certificate verification that is performed. Note that if the
      ssl_server_cert_dn parameter is not privided, host name matching is
      performed instead (default: True)

    - ssl_server_cert_dn: the distinguished name (DN) which should be matched
      with the server. This value is ignored if the ssl_server_dn_match
      parameter is not set to the value True. If specified this value is used
      for any verfication. Otherwise the hostname will be used. (default: None)

    - wallet_location: the directory where the wallet can be found. In thin
      mode this must be the directory containing the PEM-encoded wallet file
      ewallet.pem. In thick mode this must be the directory containing the file
      cwallet.sso (default: None)

    - events: boolean specifying whether events mode should be enabled. This
      value is only used in thick mode and is needed for continuous query
      notification and high availability event notifications (default: False)

    - externalauth: a boolean indicating whether to use external authentication
      (default: False)

    - mode: authorization mode to use. For example oracledb.AUTH_MODE_SYSDBA
      (default: oracledb.AUTH_MODE_DEFAULT)

    - disable_oob: boolean indicating whether out-of-band breaks should be
      disabled. This value is only used in thin mode. It has no effect on
      Windows which does not support this functionality (default: False)

    - stmtcachesize: identifies the initial size of the statement cache
      (default: oracledb.defaults.stmtcachesize)

    - edition: edition to use for the connection. This parameter cannot be used
      simultaneously with the cclass parameter (default: None)

    - tag: identifies the type of connection that should be returned from a
      pool. This value is only used in thick mode (default: None)

    - matchanytag: boolean specifying whether any tag can be used when
      acquiring a connection from the pool. This value is only used in thick
      mode. (default: False)

    - config_dir: directory in which the optional tnsnames.ora configuration
      file is located. This value is only used in thin mode. For thick mode use
      the config_dir parameter of init_oracle_client() (default:
      oracledb.defaults.config_dir)

    - appcontext: application context used by the connection. It should be a
      list of 3-tuples (namespace, name, value) and each entry in the tuple
      should be a string. This value is only used in thick mode (default: None)

    - shardingkey: a list of strings, numbers, bytes or dates that identify the
      database shard to connect to. This value is only used in thick mode
      (default: None)

    - supershardingkey: a list of strings, numbers, bytes or dates that
      identify the database shard to connect to. This value is only used in
      thick mode (default: None)

    - debug_jdwp: a string with the format "host=<host>;port=<port>" that
      specifies the host and port of the PL/SQL debugger. This value is only
      used in thin mode. For thick mode set the ORA_DEBUG_JDWP environment
      variable (default: None)

    - handle: an integer representing a pointer to a valid service context
      handle. This value is only used in thick mode. It should be used with
      extreme caution (default: 0)
